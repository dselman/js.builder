Introduction
------------

js.builder is an Eclipse Incremental Project Builder that adds the
following features:

1.	JavaScript functions can be copied from a source file to multiple destination files
	using the '@copyTo foo.js,bar.js' JavaDoc tag syntax. The builder takes care of copying
	the function to the destination files and will detect certain error conditions. This
	feature is useful if you are doing node.js development and want to share functions between
	your server and client code for example.
	
2.	Automatically upload modified files to a remote server using scp (still under development).
